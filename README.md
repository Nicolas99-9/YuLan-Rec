RecAgent is an LLM-based recommender simulator, which is expected to open a novel simulation based study paradigm in the recommendation domain. RecAgent is composed of two modules: (1) the user module and (2) the recommender module. The user module aims to simulate the real users, which can browse the recommendation website, communicate with the other users and broadcast messages on the social media. The recommender module is designed to provide the recommendation list to the users, and one can design different models to implement the recommender module. Each user maintains an individual memory, which can be automatically updated by the user behaviors. Different users take actions based on LLMs by retrieving their own memories, All the users can freely evolve in the simulator. RecAgent is highly flexible and customizable, where one can design different recommendation scenarios and algorithms. You can get the introduction video of RecAgent through the [Baidu Netdisk](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1ch8sinzFBi9XlEqp4xiYXQ?pwd=xsmq) or [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1IgsoWUipgZvnBnPSOUtbsZkm5yoyJskt/view?usp=sharing).

        - **Figure 4:** Introduced a new chart that describes the evolutionary path of model capability acquisition from the "Machine Learning era" to the "Large Language Model era" and then to the "Agent era." Specifically, a new concept, "mechanism engineering," has been introduced, which, along with "parameter learning" and "prompt engineering," forms part of this evolutionary path.

## üí° Features

- **Novel User Simulation Paradigm:** RecAgent is a novel user simulation paradigm that combines large language models (LLMs) with user behavior analysis. It is designed to simulate the behavior of real users in a recommender system. It also replicates users' social interactions, including chatting and posting. RecAgent can be used to evaluate the performance of recommender systems and to generate user behavior data for training and testing. 

- **Human-like Memory Mechanism:** RecAgent's memory mechanism mimics human cognitive processes, divided into sensory memory, short-term memory, and long-term memory. Through efficient compression and scoring of observations, it ensures the relevance and timeliness of information. By combining relevant memory with high-level insights, it achieves more realistic and consistent simulation of user behaviors. 

- **Large Scale Multi-Agent Simulation:** RecAgent is designed for robust, large-scale multi-agent parallel simulations. Seamlessly integrated with multiple OpenAI APIs, it support the capacity to simultaneously engage up to **1000** agents in its simulations. 

- **Multi-dimensional Evaluation:** We conducted an evaluation from two perspectives, that of the agent and that of the system. From the perspective of the agent, we assessed the effectiveness of various types of memory and evaluated whether the agent could access information-rich and relevant memories based on different memory structures. From the system's perspective, we focused on the reliability of the user behavior generated by our system and assessed the efficiency of the simulation.

- **High Extensibility:** RecAgent is designed to support a variety of recommendation algorithms and is equally compatible with multiple LLMs. Both aspects come with interfaces that are easy to customize.

- **Human-in-the-loop Simulation:** Individuals can create their own Agent to role-play and participate in the entire simulation process. Real people can take the same actions as other Agents, such as watching recommended movies, chatting with other Agents, or posting publicly.

- **Flexible Intervention and Control:** RecAgent provides diverse means to intervene with Agents and monitor the results. An Agent's profile can be freely modified. Moreover, people can intervene with Agents through dialogue. RecAgent also supports saving checkpoints, facilitating retrospective analysis and counterfactual studies.


## Installation

To install RecAgent, one can follow the following steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/RUC-GSAI/YuLan-Rec.git
    ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

   ```shell
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   Using `pip` to install `faiss` may report an error. One solution is to use `conda install faiss-cpu -c pytorch`.
3. Set your OpenAI API key in the `config/config.yaml` file.

## Usage

To start using RecAgent, follow these steps:

Configure the simulation parameters in the `config/config.yaml` file.

```yaml
# path for item data

```

The first `agent_num` users in `user.csv` will be loaded. Note that the `agent_num` in `config.yaml` cannot exceed the total number of users in `user.csv`.

### 1. Example

Run the simulation script:

```shell
python -u simulator.py --config_file config/config.yaml --output_file messages.json --log_file simulation.log
```

`config_file` is the path of the configuration file. `output_file` is the path of the output file, which is a JSON file containing all messages generated during the simulation. `log_file` set the path of the log file.

We will obtain some output like:
```

Click the *Play* button to start the simulation. The simulation will run for `epoch` rounds. You can click the *Reset* button to reset the simulation. Currently, the demo only supports the serial running model.

## Data

The item data used in the simulation is from the [MovieLens-1M](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/odedgolden/movielens-1m-dataset).
User profiles and relationships between users are fabricated for simulation purposes. We provide the FAISS index of the item data in directory `faiss_index`.
